Universal Automation Association Intellectual Property Rights Policy

**IP POLICY**

**Article 1: Purpose**

(i) UniversalAutomation.Org (“**UAO**” or “the Association”) is an international not-for-profit organization and independent association consisting of automation technology users and vendors committed to open automation systems. 

Its mission is to maintain, further develop and manage, on a global basis, a runtime reference implementation of the IEC 61499 standard for Industry 4.0 automated factories, processes and machines, a system level design language for modelling distributed information & control systems.  

To this end, UAO will maintain and further develop Runtime and make it available as a reference implementation to its Members, via a shared source principle (“**Purpose**”). 

Under a tiered membership scheme, certain Members will be granted access to the source code of Runtime. These Members are: 

(a)	the Platinum Members, Gold Members and Silver Members, 

(b)	the Sponsor Voting Members, Start-up Members and Academic Members that have requested and obtained written approval of the Board of Directors in accordance with Article 40.2 Articles of Association. 

Hereafter the foregoing (a) and (b) Members are collectively referred to as “**Premium Access Licensees**”. The Members under (a) may use Runtime and will also be able to assist with the further development of Runtime. For the Members under (b) use rights will depend on the specified terms of access determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with Article 40.2 Articles of Association. The Board of Directors will in written terms define whether these Members are able to use Runtime in a specific manner (e.g. limited to evaluation and testing, non-commercial internal use, confidential use, etc.) and/or assist with the further development of Runtime. 

(ii) Runtime is based on existing technology of Schneider Electric, Runtime SE. 

In accordance with the phased approach as described in Article 5 of the Articles of Association, in Phase 1 Schneider Electric will continue to develop Runtime in accordance with the Roadmap and will manage the development under its governance processes (e.g., new feature selection, prioritization, etc). As of Phase 2 of the project, UAO will take over development responsibilities for Runtime where any decision-making on development matters will be made in accordance with UAO’s general governance.

During Phase 1, Members will collaborate to prepare for Phase 2. Objective criteria to transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 have been defined as per Article 5.2 of the Articles of Association and will be monitored by the Board of Directors. Schneider Electric may resign during Phase 1 if annual progress milestones towards achieving the Transition Criteria are not met as defined in the Operating Manual. 

(iii) The Members of UAO share a common goal of promoting and further developing Runtime. Accordingly, UAO has established this IP Policy to govern the rights of UAO and its Members as of the Effective Date and promote a widespread adoption of Runtime.

All terms with a capital used in this IP Policy are defined in Annex 1 to this IP Policy (Definitions). The same definitions are to be used for Annex 2: General License Terms. 

**Article 2: Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) on Runtime – access to the shared sources – license to use Runtime**

(i) Schneider Electric hereby grants UAO an irrevocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license in relation to Runtime SE and Improvements (to be) made by Schneider Electric. This license allows UAO to sublicense Runtime SE and said Improvements to Members under the conditions as further specified in this IP Policy and the General License Terms.

(ii) UAO will assure that all Contributors that make a Contribution to Runtime will grant sufficient licenses to UAO to allow the use of Runtime to achieve the Purpose of UAO. Such licenses are granted in Article 4 and 5 of this IP Policy and in the General License Terms.

In Phase 1 IP on Contributions made by UAO will be transferred to Schneider Electric and licensed back to UAO. The manner of protection (i.e., registration of IPR) of such Phase 1 IP will be as determined at the sole discretion of Schneider Electric and any associated costs shall be borne by Schneider Electric.

In Phase 2 UAO may order external developers to develop on Runtime in accordance with the Roadmap on behalf of UAO and have Phase 2 IP transferred to UAO. It shall reserve the option, subject to Approval of the Board of Directors, to consult with specialists to register and protect its IPR through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks or other means as deemed reasonably necessary or appropriate to further the Purpose and to promote widespread use of Runtime. 

(iii) Premium Access Licensees agree to be bound by the General License Terms. 

The General License Terms allow Premium Access Licensees access to the source code of Runtime, and depending on their membership level and/or the terms of access determined by the Board of Directors, use Runtime in a specific manner and/or make Contributions to the further development of Runtime in accordance with the relevant governance process and the Roadmap.

**Article 3: IPR on Improvements to Runtime** 

Premium Access Licensees with the required membership level or terms of access allowing further development of Runtime, are only allowed to develop and implement Improvements in accordance with the General License Terms. They are not permitted to develop Runtime on their own, independent of UAO. All development work is to be aligned in accordance with the Roadmap. There are thus only UAO-approved versions of Runtime to which all Members must be committed, and no vendor-specific versions are permitted or supported, unless provided for by the Roadmap.

IP in any Improvement remains with the Premium Access Licensee that made the Improvement. Such Improvements shall be licensed to UAO in Article 4 and 5 of this IP Policy and in the General License Terms.

Each Premium Access Licensee is always allowed access to the latest version of Runtime.

**Article 4: License in respect of Contributions & Improvements** 

(a) 	Relevant IPR in the Contributions remain with the Contributor. Each Contributor however hereby grants, an irrevocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license under the relevant IPR, excluding Essential Claims, on its Contributions to UAO to:

(i)	use, create derivative works (including to modify, change, translate and adapt), copy and internally distribute any of its Contributions in order to develop Improvements; and

(ii)	copy, publish, distribute, disseminate and display any of its Contributions that are adopted and integrated in Runtime as Improvements.

This license is granted for the entire duration that the Contributions are protected by any applicable category of the relevant IPR.

Essential Claims are addressed in Article 5 of this IP Policy,

(b)	A Contributor provides all Contributions as-is and without any warranty.

(c)	UAO may sublicense Contributions to its Premium Access Licensees for the purpose of Article 4 (a) (i) and (ii), and include the right for the latter to grant sublicenses to (1) their Affiliates and (2) if the Premium Access Licensee is a Vendor/Supplier, to its customers and the customers’ designated subcontractors using Runtime on behalf of the customers and under the customers’ responsibility insofar that this sublicense (i) is necessary to allow the use by its customers of the Vendor/Supplier’s product in which Runtime is used and (ii) is limited to such use. 

(d)	In case the Contributions are Improvements or Runtime SE, the license and sublicenses are further defined in the General License Terms. 

(e)	All Contributions (including Improvements) by a Member that are marked as confidential or proprietary, are made to UAO under the condition that these Contributions will be treated as confidential or proprietary to the contributing Member, by UAO and other Members and must be treated as such by UAO and the other Members.

If Contributions however concern Feedback, such Contributions are considered confidential information of UAO, and not of the contributing Member. A Contributor must not disclose such Contributions to any outside third party or any other Member who is not a participant in the relevant committee or working group without consent of UAO. 

A Contributor should not Include trade secrets in Contributions if such Contributor wishes to maintain trade secret protection. 

**Article 5:  Evaluation IP & Essential Claims License Grant** 

(a) UAO will provide its potential members a confidential IP Evaluation Package to allow these potential members to evaluate the scope of any Essential Claims in respect of Runtime and the then current version of the Roadmap when entering into the UAO and the obligations of this IP Policy.

The Board of Directors of UAO may decide to refrain from providing an IP Evaluation Package to a third party, if it has reasons to believe that such party has no genuine interest in using Runtime. In that case, the Board of Directors shall substantiate such decision.

(b) **Essential Claims License Grant.**  

Absent timely delivery of an Exclusion Request or an Exclusion Notice in compliance with the process set forth in subsections (e) or (f) respectively, then effective upon completion of a Review Period, each Member hereby grants to UAO, or will cause its Affiliates to grant, an irrevocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license, in accordance with Article 5(c), to its Essential Claims in Runtime in order to allow making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell, importing, distributing or disposing of Runtime; provided however, that such license does not extend to any part or function of a product (other than Runtime) in which Runtime is incorporated. This license shall survive the termination of the membership of the Member.  

This license is granted for the duration of the protection of the Essential Claims. 

(c) UAO may grant a corresponding sublicense to its Premium Access Licensees and include the right for the latter to grant sublicenses to (1) their Affiliates and (2) if the Premium Access Licensee is a Vendor/Supplier, to its customers and the customers’ designated subcontractors using Runtime on behalf of the customers and under the customers’ responsibility insofar that this sublicense (i) is necessary to allow the use by its customers of the Vendor/Supplier’s product in which Runtime is used and (ii) is limited to such use. No other sublicenses are permitted.   

(d) If a potential member does not avail itself of the IP Evaluation Package prior to joining, it will be deemed to consent to the license in this article 5(b) as if it had reviewed such Package.

(e) **Opt-Out of Essential Claims License upon joining as a Member**

(i) A potential member will have 60 days (the “Review Period”) following receipt of the IP Evaluation Package to deliver written notice of its request (an “Exclusion Request”) to the Board of Directors to opt-out of the license requirement of Article 5(b) with respect to any Essential Claims; To be effective, an Exclusion Request must include: (A) the patent number(s) or title and application number(s), as the case may be, for each of the issued patent(s) or pending patent application(s) that a potential member reasonably believes may contain Essential Claims the potential member requests to exclude from its license requirement under Article 5(b); and (B) a reference to the functionality in Runtime to which the Member believes the Essential Claims relate.  

(ii) On such prior written request to the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors’ written approval, this potential member may opt out of such Essential Claims license in relation to both specifically identified IP and specifically identified technical features of Runtime, and still become a Member to UAO. 

(iii) A potential member may during the Review Period also submit an Exclusion Request to the Board of Directors to opt-out of the license requirement of Article 5(b) with respect to any Essential Claims of its Affiliates or some of its Affiliates. To be effective, such Exclusion Request must include (A) full corporate identification details of the Affiliates and (B) a reason for the exclusion. On such prior written request to the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors’ written approval, this potential member may opt out of such Essential Claims license in relation to such Affiliates, and still become a Member to UAO. If the Board of Directors refuses to approve the Exclusion Request, the Board of Directors shall substantiate such decision. 

(iv) In the event that a potential member’s Exclusion Request is not approved by the Board of Directors, the potential member may decide to not join UAO as a member even if the Review Period has expired. The potential member may also appeal the decision of the Board of Directors to the Membership Assembly in the same way as provided in Art. 7.3, 2nd paragraph, of the Articles of Association.

(f) **Opt-Out of Essential Claims License after joining as a Member**: 

(i) 	Prior to implementing any feature of the Phase 1 Backlog (in Phase 1) or any Qualified Feature Request (in Phase 2) as an Improvement, Schneider Electric (in Phase 1) or UAO (in Phase 2), must publish to Members the Minimum Functional Description of each feature request being considered for addition to Runtime.

A Member may during the first month of the Review Period as defined in (f)(ii), file a detailed request (with reference to specific IPR of that Member) to receive further information if in its view the Minimum Functional Description is not sufficient to assess whether the New Feature Request could infringe this Member’s IPR. In the absence of such detailed request, the Minimum Functional Description is deemed sufficient. A request to receive further information does not extend the Review Period. 

(ii)	Members will have 60 Days (the “Review Period”) following notice of the publication described in (f)(i), to deliver written notice (an “Exclusion Notice”) to Schneider Electric in Phase 1 or UAO in Phase 2 (as the case may be) of its decision to opt-out of the license requirement of Article 5(b) with respect to any Essential Claims; provided however, that a Member may not exclude any Essential Claims in the Member’s own Contribution. To be effective, an Exclusion Notice must include: (A) the patent number(s) or title and application number(s), as the case may be, for each of the issued patent(s) or pending patent application(s) that a Member reasonably believes may contain Essential Claims the Member intends to exclude from its license requirement under Article 5(b); and (B) a reference to the functionality in the feature request to which the Member believes the Essential Claims relate.  

(iii) 	A Member is bound by the license requirement of Article 5(b) with respect to any Essential Claim for which that Member does not provide timely written notice to opt-out by means of such Exclusion Notice. An Exclusion Notice shall not be effective to exclude any Essential Claims in any Runtime or Improvement for which a Review Period has been completed prior to delivery of such Exclusion Notice.

(iv) 	A Member may also during its membership submit an Exclusion Notice of its decision to opt-out of the license requirement of Article 5(b) with respect to any Essential Claims of a new established Affiliate. To be effective, such Exclusion Notice must include (A) full corporate identification details of the new established Affiliate and (B) a reason for the exclusion. The Exclusion Notice must be submitted within 60 Days of the establishment of the new Affiliate. 

(v) 	A Member that provides an Exclusion Notice in accordance with this Article 5(f), may continue its participation as a Member and the case being, may continue to participate in UAO corporate bodies and committees.

**Article 6: Conflicting third party IPR**

UAO and all Members shall each take care through reasonable efforts and precautions, to avoid infringements on third party IPR in the development and use of Runtime.

Both in Phase 1 and in Phase 2, the Board of Directors will decide on what UAO budget will be used for "Freedom to operate" searches in relation to Runtime as it is further developed and third party IPR, and on what aspects, IPR, and/or territories to focus such "Freedom to operate" searches. The results of these “Freedom to operate” searches will be shared with the Members on a confidential basis. These searches are without prejudice to Members’ own responsibility to clear the use of Runtime in business.

**Article 7: End of membership; survival of licenses**

The license granted by UAO to a Premium Access Licensee to use Runtime survives the termination of the membership, but becomes limited to (i) the then current Runtime version and (ii) the Premium Access Licensee’s then current use of Runtime, at the moment that it leaves. This means that at termination of the membership, the Premium Access Licensee’s then current products can continue to be commercialized using the then current Runtime, but such Premium Access Licensee cannot develop and launch new products on the market based on the Runtime current at termination, nor update any products with versions of Runtime developed after termination. Use of Runtime source code is limited to supporting an existing installed base of the then current product in order to allow the Premium Access Licensee to continue to sell that product after termination of its membership.

The licenses granted by a Member to UAO survive without modification the termination of a Member’s membership. 


**Article 8: Consequences of dissolution of UAO for IP**

The consequences of the dissolution of UAO for IP are contingent upon when the dissolution occurs.

(i) If UAO is legally dissolved during Phase 1, UAO’s rights and obligations in relation to licensing from and to Members will automatically be transferred to Schneider Electric:

The license granted to a Premium Access Licensee persists unchanged but will now be granted by Schneider Electric. The license will however be limited to (i) the then current Runtime version and (2) the then current use by the Premium Access Licensee of Runtime, at the time of dissolution of UAO. Use of Runtime source code is limited to supporting an existing installed base of the then current product in order to allow the Premium Access Licensee to continue to sell the same product. The Premium Access Licensee must cease any other use of Runtime. 

The licenses granted by a Member to UAO survive without modification the dissolution of UAO, but will now be deemed granted to Schneider Electric for the purpose of providing the license to Premium Access Licensees as provided in the previous paragraph.

(ii) If UAO is legally dissolved during Phase 2, the consequences of unwinding UAO are to be decided within the UAO governance framework.

**Article 9: Governing law and jurisdiction**

(i) All disputes concerning the validity, interpretation, enforcement, performance and termination of this IP Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Belgian law. No effect shall be given to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-laws rules or provisions that would cause the laws of any other jurisdiction to be applicable.

(ii) Any disputes between the UAO and a Member, arising out of or in relation to this IP Policy shall be exclusively and definitively settled in accordance with the rules of CEPANI, by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with these rules. The place of arbitration shall be Brussels and the language of the proceedings shall be English.

Before instituting proceedings before CEPANI, UAO (via the Board of Directors) and such Member will, however, attempt to negotiate in good faith in order to reach an amicable settlement. If such amicable settlement is not reached within two months, UAO and such Member agree to resort to arbitration as referred to in the previous paragraph.

By way of exception, in the event of a need for provisional measures, a party may turn to the court in the jurisdiction in which the provisional measures should be implemented.

**Article 10: Priority**

In case of any conflict between the text of the Articles of Association, the IP Policy and its Annexes, and the Operating Manual, the order of priority will be as follows:

\- The Articles of Association take priority,

\- Then, the IP Policy and its Annexes,

\- Finally, the Operating Manual. 

**Article 11: Invalid provisions**

11.1 	In the event that any of the provisions of this IP Policy and its Annexes, or any part of any provision is judged illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the other provisions will not be affected by this and will remain in full force and effect. In this case UAO and the Members, within the limits of the applicable law, will draft a new stipulation that meets the objectives intended by the void or unenforceable stipulation, and will include this as an appendix to this IP Policy.

# **PART I: PRELIMINARY CLAUSES**
## **ARTICLE 1: GENERAL LICENSE TERMS**

1.1	The General License Terms determine the terms and conditions of (1) the license granted by Schneider Electric to UAO on Runtime SE, (2) the licenses granted by Premium Access Licensees to UAO in relation to Improvements and (3) the license on Runtime granted by UAO to Premium Access Licensees. 

1.2	In the performance of these General License Terms the Parties hereto shall be deemed to be independent contract parties, and the employees of one shall not be deemed to be employees of the other. Nothing in these General License Terms shall be construed to make either Party an agent, employee, joint venturer, partner or legal representative of the other Party. Each Party shall not have, or represent itself to have, any authority to bind or commit the other Party to any oral or written contract, understanding or obligation on the basis of these General License Terms.

# **PART II: LICENSE GRANTED TO PREMIUM ACCESS LICENSEE**
## **ARTICLE 2: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS**

2.1	Premium Access Licensees recognize that all Intellectual Property Rights in Runtime are vested with UAO or a Member that UAO has entered into a relevant license agreement with, e.g. Schneider Electric (in relation to Runtime SE and Improvements), or other Members (in relation to Contributions, Improvements included). Such relevant license agreement can take the form of the IP Policy and/or these General License Terms.  Use of third-party software and open source software in Runtime is subject to approval of the Board of Directors. Any approved third party and open source software licenses must be available either for transfer, license or sublicense to Premium Access Licensees.

2.2	Nothing in these General License Terms will be understood as granting to Premium Access Licensees any other rights in Runtime than the license rights explicitly granted to them, under Article 3 hereof. 

2.3	Premium Access Licensees will observe UAO’s (and/or applicable other Member) Intellectual Property Rights at all times and make all reasonable efforts to protect said rights. Premium Access Licensees will immediately inform UAO of any infringement of these Intellectual Property Rights by third parties of which they become aware.
## **ARTICLE 3: LICENSE** 

3.1	UAO grants to Premium Access Licensees an irrevocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license, or the case being sublicense, under all relevant IPR, to use Runtime as a Vendor/Supplier, a User, a Silicon Component Supplier or an Academic/Research Institute. This license is granted for the entire duration of protection under any applicable category of licensed relevant IPR. The licensed use relates to either:

(1) manufacturing hardware and/or software products that use Runtime (i.e. use as a “Vendor/Supplier”); 

(2) the use by a user (including but not limited to end user, system integrator, process OEM and machine builder) of the automation products that use Runtime specified under (1) and purchased from a Vendor/Supplier (i.e. use as a “User”); 

(3) use as a manufacturer of silicon components that will execute Runtime (i.e. use as a “Silicon Component Supplier”); 

(4) use as an academic or research institute performing educational or research activities related to Runtime (i.e. use as an “Academic/Research Institute”).

Terms of access determined by the Board of Directors for Sponsor Voting Members, Start-up Members and Academic Members requesting access to the source codes of Runtime, may define additional restrictions to the allowed use, such as by limiting it to non-commercial internal use, evaluation and testing purposes, confidential use, etc. The Premium Access Licensee is responsible for full compliance with the individual terms of access defined by the Board of Directors upon its particular request.

Moreover, if the Premium Access Licensees have the required membership level (Platinum, Gold or Silver) or their terms of access determined by the Board of Directors allow further development on the source code of Runtime, and they want to participate in the further development of Runtime, the license granted also allows the use of Runtime by the Premium Access Licensees for the development of Improvements in accordance with the Roadmap:

\- during Phase 1: if approved by Schneider Electric and,

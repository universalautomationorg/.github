## What is UniversalAutomation.Org?

**UniversalAutomation.Org (UAO) is an independent, not-for-profit association that will drive innovation in industry by decoupling automation application software from the hardware on which it executes.**
  

UniversalAutomation.Org manages using shared-source principles, a runtime execution engine based on the IEC 61499 standard.

This github site is the secure repository for the IEC 61499 runtime engine source code.

**IEC 61499 introduces several new concepts in industrial automation:**

* Use of software components in the form of graphical event-driven Function Blocks (FB’s)
* Decoupling of the application software from the hardware on which it executes

   - Application model defining how to build applications consisting of networks of event-driven FB’s and nested FB’s.
   - Device/Resource models defining the hardware devices and resources on which the application will run
   - System model to map the application to the device/resources
   
The end result is the ability to build applications using hardware-independent software components that can be distributed to the automation/edge compute architecture.

UAO provides a **ready-to-go solution** that enables flexible Industry 4.0 automation architectures and drastically improves return on investment on application software by supporting reusability and portability across hardware platforms.  

The ongoing development of the runtime is managed by the association following shared source principles to ensure portability of software components and interoperability of devices in a distributed system. Members act collectively, sharing technology development, insights, and information to create a market of “plug and produce” automation solutions.

UniversalAutomation.Org is expanding with more End Users/SIs/OEMs and vendors joining to to use the IEC 61499 technology. Any entity looking to help advance industrial automation is welcome to join.

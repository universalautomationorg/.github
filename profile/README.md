**What is UniversalAutomation.Org?**

UniversalAutomation.org (UAO) is an independent, not-for-profit association that will unleash innovation by decoupling application software from the hardware on which it executes. 
  
UniversalAutomation.org manages and shares a runtime execution engine based on the IEC 61499 standard which decouples automation application software from the hardware it executes on. UAO provides a ready-to-go solution that enables flexible Industry 4.0 automation architectures and drastically improves return on investment on application software by supporting reusability and portability across hardware platforms. 
  
The ongoing development of the runtime is managed by the association following shared source principles to ensure compatibility. Members act collectively, sharing technology development, insights, and information to create a market of “plug and produce” automation solutions. 
  
UniversalAutomation.org is expanding with more end users/SIs/OEMs and vendors eager to implement the runtime in their products. Any entity looking to help advance industrial automation is welcome to join.
